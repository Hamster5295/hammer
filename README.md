# Hammer

This library provides utilities for [Chisel](https://www.chisel-lang.org/)  
Might be able to save time and hair of hardware devs

## Quick Start

`Hammer` has no dependencies on either other libraries or build tools.  

You can clone this repo to your project's `src/main/scala` folder, and everything is done!
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Hamster5295/hammer
```

> Why the heck are build tools SO COMPLECATED for Java family?

## Documention

**TODO!**

Currently there're only a few simple tools separated in source files.  
You can get a brief knowledge about what `hammer` provides through reading the file names.  

File Organization:
* `chisel` - **Compile Time** utils that helps creating hardware faster
* `model` - Golden model for various data structures for testbench purposes
* `test` - Utils for writing better and faster tests
